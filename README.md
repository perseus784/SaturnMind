# SaturnMind
A repo to understand Reinforcement Learning, a first step towards general AI.


## Introduction :
**Step 1** : Define your environment and set your actions, goal.  
            
            E.g.
            Environment : Super Mario.(The Best game ever!)    
            Actions : move forward, jump, duck, long jump etc. 
            Goal : Retrieving the princess.
            
**Step 2** : Initialize Q table wth states and actions.  

            States- Current state or Position in the environment.
                    E.g. Current location of Mario in the frame.
            Action- List freedom of movements in the environment that is defined.  
  
  Like this one :  
  
 | State | Forward | Jump | Duck | Ljump |
 |-------|---------|------|------|-------|
 | 0     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0   |
 | 1     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0   |
 | 2     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0   |

***Now our job is to train and adapt the above Q table by interacting with the environment in following steps*** 

**Step 3** : 

           # under construction!
            
            


## Projects :
1. [**Grid Pathfinder**](https://github.com/perseus784/SaturnMind/blob/master/Pathfinder.py) :

*Prerequisite :*
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib


A program to navigate through a grid even with blocks in the grid.
Code segments are explained in commented lines.
Qlearning table is used.
Feel free to experiment with the variables.
