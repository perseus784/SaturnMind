# SaturnMind
A repo to understand Reinforcement Learning, a first step towards general AI.


## Introductions:
**Step 1**: Define your environment and set your actions.  

            e.g. Super Mario    
            Actions: move forward, jump, duck, long jump etc.  
            
**Step 2**: Initialize Q table wth states and actions.  

            States- Current state or Position in the environment.
            Action- List freedom of movements in the environment that is defined.  
  
  Like this one:  
  
 | State | Forward | Jump | Duck | Ljump |
 |-------|---------|------|------|-------|
 | 0     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0   |
 | 1     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0   |
 | 2     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0   |

***Now our job is to train and adapt the above Q table by interacting with the environment in following steps*** 

**Step 3**: 
           #under construction!
            
            


## Projects:
1. [**Grid Pathfinder**](https://github.com/perseus784/SaturnMind/blob/master/Pathfinder.py) :

*Prerequisite:*
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib


A program to navigate through a grid even with blocks in the grid.
Code segments are explained in commented lines.
Qlearning table is used.
Feel free to experiment with the variables.
